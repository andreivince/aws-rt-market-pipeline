# Real-Time Market Data Pipeline

> 🚀 **Live infrastructure. Real AWS deployment. Not a toy repo.**

This project is my first production-grade backend — an open-source, serverless **real-time market data pipeline** built to run at scale under extreme constraints:

- ⚙️ Deployed with **AWS CDK (TypeScript)** using Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway  
- 💸 Designed for **1M+ req/month at sub-$10/month** infra cost  
- 🔁 Currently running with **simulated tick data ingestion + DynamoDB storage**

I'm building it in public. No fluff. No "learning project" disclaimers.  
If you're into high-throughput infra, AWS-native ops, and real observability — this is for you.

## 🚀 Project Overview

A **serverless, production-grade pipeline** designed for **real-time market data** (stocks, crypto, FX) delivering:

- ⚡ **Sub-150ms p95 latency** at scale (≥1M requests/month)  
- 💸 **Ultra-low infrastructure cost** (< $10/month)  
- 🔧 **Fully automated CI/CD pipeline** with zero manual ops  
- 🔍 **Deep observability** using CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Grafana  
- 🌐 **REST & WebSocket APIs** powered by AWS CDK (TypeScript)  

This project is **not just a demo** — it simulates a **high-throughput, resilient, and cost-effective financial data infrastructure** under real-world constraints.

## ❓ Why This Matters

Building trading systems, analytics dashboards, or real-time APIs? This project proves:

- ✅ Serverless architectures *can* achieve sub-200ms latencies  
- ✅ Costs don’t have to increase linearly with traffic  
- ✅ AWS native tools fully support real operational workloads

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    Feed["Market Data Feed (Simulated)"] --> LambdaIngest["Lambda: Ingest"]
    LambdaIngest --> Dynamo["DynamoDB Ticks"]
    Dynamo --> Stream["DynamoDB Streams"]
    Stream --> LambdaFanout["Lambda: Fan-out Dispatcher"]
    LambdaFanout --> LambdaWS["Lambda: WebSocket Broadcaster"]
    LambdaWS --> ApiGWWS["API Gateway WS"]
    Stream --> LambdaQuery["Lambda: Query"]
    LambdaQuery --> APIGW["API Gateway REST"]
```

**Key components explained:**

- **Market Data Feed:** Simulated tick data generator feeding ingestion  
- **Lambda: Ingest:** Processes incoming ticks, writes to DynamoDB  
- **DynamoDB:** Stores tick data with streams enabled for fan-out  
- **Lambda: Query:** Serves REST API queries efficiently  
- **Lambda: Fan-out Dispatcher:** Listens to DynamoDB Streams to push updates  
- **Lambda: WebSocket Broadcaster:** Sends real-time updates to connected clients via WebSocket API Gateway  

This architecture ensures **low-latency, scalable, and cost-effective** real-time data delivery.
